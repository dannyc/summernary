<h4>Q: I really want to join the program, but I can't afford to pay that much money. Is there anything I can do?</h4>
A: No one will be turned away due to funding. Please contact us to work something out.
	</p>
	<p>
<h4>Q: I can only make it to some of the classes/activities being offered. Is there a part time fee?</h4>
A: We are very excited to have everyone join us. At this time, there are no part time options. If this is a concern of yours, please contact us.
	</p>
	<p>
<h4>Q: Do you need to be on a certain learning level to join the Summernary?</h4>
A: We are pleased to be able to offer shiurim on a number of levels (from some amazing teachers). In addition, we will have a teacher available to answer questions that come up during chavruta learning to help figure things out.
	</p>
	<p>
<h4>Q: Will there be swag?</h4>
A: YES!!!
	</p>
	<p>
<h4>Q: Will the Rebbeim be around all day?</h4>
A: Rabbi Turetsky, Rav Moshe Tzvi, and Rav Rafi plan on being around from the start of the day until the wee hours of the night (or whenever people go home). In addition to giving shiurim and answering questions in the Beit, we will be around to shmooze at lunch time and after night seder is over.
	</p>

<h4>Q: What is included in night seder?</h4>
A: The night seder program will offer us an opportunity to hear from some of the best teachers and speakers in America. We are in the process of arranging an amazing list of guest speakers. As soon as we finalize everything, we will publish a list of speakers.

<h4>Q: I don't live in Teaneck. Is there any way to make it easier for me to participate?</h4>
A: There are a number of girls in the Teaneck area who have graciously offered to host girls at their houses for the week of Summernary.  If you don't want to stay in Teaneck (or are unable to stay there for the week), there are also a lot of girls who are coming from other communities. It is possible that we can help facilitate a carpool. If you are interested in finding out more, please contact us.

We would also like to offer mini refresher courses (some options include hilchot brachot, hilchot kashrut, hilchot tefillah, hilchot lashon hara, hilchot kibud av v'em).
